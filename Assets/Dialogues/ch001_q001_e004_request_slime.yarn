Emma: Good morning, what are you doing up so early in the morning? #line:0a0c6dc 
Farmer: The slimes are destroying my field! Help me! #line:098d615 
Emma: What? Slimes coming into the village? That's unusual! #line:0a0e77d 
Farmer: This is no time to be thinking! If we don't defeat the slimes soon, they'll melt my crops and ruin everything! #line:082b0ea 
Emma: You're right, you're right. I'm sure you can defeat the slimes in no time, so let's go help this man! #line:0aba158
