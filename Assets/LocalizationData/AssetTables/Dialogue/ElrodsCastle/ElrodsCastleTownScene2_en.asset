      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542016
    m_Localized: You guys look kind of strong. I was wondering if you could do me
      a favor...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542017
    m_Localized: You're asking us for a favor? What is going on here?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542018
    m_Localized: I work as a lumberjack, but there are goblins in the woods, and
      I can't do my job with them around.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542019
    m_Localized: They're chopping and burning trees without care, and if this keeps
      up, the forest will be ruined. Can you help me get rid of the goblins in the
      woods, please?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542020
    m_Localized: I get it. But why ask us? If it's just goblins, I bet the Castle's
      Knights could take them out quickly if we request their help...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73683542021
    m_Localized: Yeah, I tried asking the Castle Knights first. I wanted them to
      deal with the goblins in the forest.

      help him?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73687736322
    m_Localized: I guess the Knights must be busy fighting off demons elsewhere and
      are short on help. It might be better if we lend him a hand instead.
