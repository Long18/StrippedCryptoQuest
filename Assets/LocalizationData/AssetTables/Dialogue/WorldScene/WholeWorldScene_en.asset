    m_Localized: Sorry. You can't cross the bridge right now...

    m_Localized: "Oh...\u3000I give up...."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: "What\u2019s wrong, Mister?"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865920
    m_Localized: I'm a carpenter, and they asked me to fix this broken bridge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865921
    m_Localized: I would have thought a bridge of this size could be fixed in no
      time...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865922
    m_Localized: But what?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865923
    m_Localized: Oh, when I tried to fix the bridge, a huge fish attacked me!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865924
    m_Localized: I escaped in a hurry and was safe, but it was a huge, ferocious
      fish...!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865925
    m_Localized: Is there such an amazing fish?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865926
    m_Localized: Oh no, when I gazed upon the shattered pieces of the bridge, I couldn't
      see any signs of damage caused by the weather or time passing.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865927
    m_Localized: I'm sure the fish is the one to blame for this ruined bridge. The
      bridge probably broke under it's enormous size when it traveled through here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865928
    m_Localized: It's been swimming around here, and I'm afraid it'll attack me again
      if I try to fix the bridge.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865929
    m_Localized: I see...we'll be in trouble too if we can't get through here....
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865930
    m_Localized: Mister, do you know where that ferocious fish went?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865931
    m_Localized: I think it went to that little fishing village over there now...
      Uni village, I think.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865932
    m_Localized: It goes back and forth from this river to that fishing village.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865933
    m_Localized: I heard that the people in the fishing villages are also having
      problems with their boats and fish traps being destroyed and the fish they
      catch being devoured!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865934
    m_Localized: Oh, okay. I get it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865935
    m_Localized: It looks like we won't be able to fix the bridge with that fish
      around, and the others seem to be annoyed, so let's take it down ourselves.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70646865936
    m_Localized: So this is the Uni village.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060224
    m_Localized: We should get ready before we go in, because there could be a ferocious
      fish out there at any moment. Are you ready?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060225
    m_Localized: All right! Let's go into the village then!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060226
    m_Localized: I understand. It's important to be careful.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060227
    m_Localized: Let's get ready before we enter the village.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060228
    m_Localized: Hey there! I heard you beat that fish monster, thanks!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060229
    m_Localized: Thanks to you guys, I can focus on working safely and as you can
      see, the bridge is back to normal!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060230
    m_Localized: Wow, the bridge is already fixed! A man who can work is different,
      huh?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060231
    m_Localized: Aahaha! That's right!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060232
    m_Localized: Alright! Let's cross towards the port town of Ether!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060233
    m_Localized: It looks like the only way to get to the next town is through these
      woods.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060234
    m_Localized: If you look at the map, you can see that if you go straight east,
      you will soon reach the next big port town named Ether.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060235
    m_Localized: But...as you probably know, this forest is called the lost forest
      for a reason.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060236
    m_Localized: "It may not be that easy to travel through the forest, so let\u2019s
      be prepared before we go."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060237
    m_Localized: Are you ready to enter the Lost Forest?
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: "All right! Let\u2019s go!"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060239
    m_Localized: We don't know what lies ahead, so let's get a little more prepared
      before we go.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060240
    m_Localized: "Oh, there he is! There he is! That\u2019s him!"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060241
    m_Localized: Hey Thief! Give us back his wallet!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70651060242
    m_Localized: Whoa!!! I thought they were a bunch of dummies who didn't notice
      anything, so how did they find me!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254528
    m_Localized: Damn it, they can't get me!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254529
    m_Localized: If it comes to this...!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254530
    m_Localized: My Hero, What are we going to do! Do you still want to chase after
      him?!
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: Alright! Then follow me!
    m_Metadata:

  - m_Id: 70655254532
    m_Localized: Well, we're going into the Lost Forest, so why don't we get a few
      things ready?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254533
    m_Localized: But without your wallet... Oh, you have a little bit of money that
      you've separated in another luggage.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254534
    m_Localized: Then let's get ready with that extra money and go after him.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254535
    m_Localized: I don't think that the thief will be able to get through the Lost
      Forest that easily, so I don't think we need to rush.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254536
    m_Localized: This seems like a magical door that can't be opened by force.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254537
    m_Localized: It's a very big tower, so I'm curious...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254538
    m_Localized: but I won't be able to get in unless we figure out how to open the

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70655254544
    m_Localized: Huh?
    m_Metadata:

      come in?
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70667837441
